# pkg_automation

It is the most cummbersome thing that is to install required packages for EPICS and other applications in different Linux flavors. Mostly, my enviornment has two-folds : CentOS and Debian. Since 2012, I am struggling to save my time to do this. Here is the first what I wants to do.

It is tested with CentOS 7, and Debain 8. And sudo permission is needed. 

```
$ bash pkg_automation.bash 

>>>> CentOS is detected as CentOS Core 7.4.1708
>>>> Do you want to continue (y/n)?

```

```
$ bash pkg_automation.bash

>>>> Debian is detected as Debian jessie 8.9
>>>> Do you want to continue (y/n)?
```
